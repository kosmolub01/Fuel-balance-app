## Additional Information
The application automatically detects car movement, records the route, and calculates the amount of fuel consumed. The user enters information into the app about how much fuel their car consumes per 100 km and how much they have refueled. 
Thanks to the application, the user knows the total amount of consumed and purchased fuel. When the app detects car movement, a notification is generated to start recording the route. At any time, the user can permanently disable automatic route recording. 
The user can review the history of routes and delete selected routes from the history. 

For individuals sharing one car, tracking consumed and purchased fuel can be time-consuming, and the solution used in car rentals (returning the car with a full tank) is impractical, as it requires refueling after each trip. The app solves this problem.

## Project Status
